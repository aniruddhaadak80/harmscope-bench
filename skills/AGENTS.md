# Authoring skills

A skill is a folder under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md`.

## HARDLINE standards

These are not preferences. A change that violates them does not merge.

1. **Frontmatter is required and valid.** The file starts with `---`. Keys: `name`
   (kebab-case, unique across the catalog), `description` (one sentence, says when to
   use it), `metadata.version` (semver).
2. **Bump `metadata.version` on every body change.** Not only on breaking changes — on
   any change a user would want to receive.
3. **The body is instructions to an agent, not prose about the project.** Second person,
   imperative, numbered steps, no marketing.
4. **Name the exact commands.** `harmscope-bench doctor`, not "run the diagnostic".
5. **Declare provenance.** Anything adapted from elsewhere sets `metadata.upstream*` and
   gets an `ATTRIBUTION.md` row.
6. **No secrets, no absolute paths, no machine-specific assumptions.**
