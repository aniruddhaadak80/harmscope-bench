# Harmscope Bench overview

## When to use this

You are orienting yourself in Harmscope Bench and need the map, not the detail.

## The one idea

Every capability in Harmscope Bench is a **Tool** registered in exactly one registry. The CLI,
the terminal bench, the web app and the MCP server are thin transports over that one registry.
There is no second code path.

## The other one

The product has no code path which produces an ethical judgement. It has code paths which
produce **refusals with a named reason**. Ask it whether an appeal path is adequate and it tells
you the evidence it wants; it will not tell you the deployment is ethical, because that is not a
question it is willing to answer with a number.

## Steps

1. Run `harmscope-bench doctor` — it probes every subsystem and prints a fix hint per failing row.
2. Run `harmscope-bench tools` — the authoritative list of capabilities.
3. Open a case and work its queue:

   ```bash
   harmscope-bench queue --case <id>
   ```

4. Read `docs/architecture.md` for the narrow waist and the footprint ladder.

## Where capability belongs

In order of preference. Adding to the core registry is the _last_ option, not the first:

1. Extend an existing tool
2. Add a CLI command plus a skill
3. Add a service-gated tool
4. Add a plugin
5. Add an MCP server tool to the catalog
6. Add a new core tool

## Verify

`harmscope-bench doctor` exits 0 and `harmscope-bench tools` lists at least one tool.
