  the web app, the MCP server, and every channel.
- `harmscope-bench doctor` — subsystem probes with a fix hint per failing row.
- The deterministic Python engine, called as a pure function over stdin/stdout.
- The skills catalog with frontmatter validation and a CI version gate.
- The plugin registry with schema validation and priority-based conflict resolution.
- SQLite storage with WAL, numbered migrations, and FTS5 search.
- An MCP server exposing the registry over stdio, plus an MCP client.
- The web workspace, deployed to Vercel, with a real `/api/health` endpoint.
